On one hand, the older, often PHP (Magento, OpenCart) or ASP.Net (NopCommerce) based solutions that are supposed to be deployed and maintained manually. And on the other hand, the newer, cloud-based SaaS solutions such as Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Workarea and BigCommerce.</Paragraph>\n\n          <Paragraph>In this scattered market, enterprise retailers usually end up choosing SaaS solutions because of their more modern architecture. However, this choice is made at the expense of flexibility and hosting costs.</Paragraph>\n\n          <Paragraph>Reaction Commerce bridges this gap, allowing enterprise retailers to benefit from the latest web technologies (Node.js, React, MongoDB) while keeping total control over their deployment process and cloud bills. It can be deployed on-premise, or on any public cloud thanks to it being built around Docker.</Paragraph>\n\n          <Title color={blue}>Book a free consulting session.</Title>\n\n          <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: \"2rem\" }}>Pick a time below for our consultants to assess your needs in a free 30-minute session.
